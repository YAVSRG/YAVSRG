turn question marks to dollar signs
Coming at you live
We like to party, we like, we like to party

Progress over perfection
This is not labeled as pop
How come I end up where I started?
the beat is so nasty why is this just an interlude
DO WE HAVE A DEAL SIR?
Once everyone's asleep, it's my turn to shine...
If at first you don't succeed, FIND OUT WHY
Good things come to those who act
Your life is your own
You're a little offbeat
Do it for the weekend
the choke mind virus
A moment of quiet is all that it takes
We'll go down in history
Do you remember what he said?
DON'T LOSE YOUR WAY
One of a kind
The slop thickens
He's done it again, folks!
Yesterday, Today, and Forever
Built for fun
Slow motion is better than no motion
Join the party
Start as you mean to continue

Just one more song
Take it to the bridge

ICE COLD???
*Gulp gulp gulp*
You check all my boxes¬Check! Check!

What do we find beyond this horizon?
In the moment, on the edge, over the top but under the radar
