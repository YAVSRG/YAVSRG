As previously mentioned if anyone has collections they want to keep let me know in the discord.</p></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc"><p class="leading-8 mb-4">There are two kinds of collection: Folders and Playlists
Folders are groups of charts like osu! 'collections'
Playlists are ordered lists of charts including the gameplay modifiers and a specific rate for the chart</p></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc"><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Added library views: All, Collections and Table
These are what gets shown on level select.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">'Table' view is a placeholder for more fleshed out table features
'Collections' view lists all collections
'All' is just the normal list of every chart you have</p></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc"><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You can quick-add and quick-remove charts from a 'selected' collection (more info is provided by the relevant menus)

Also you can now focus it by pressing Z (by default)
This lets you navigate it with the keyboard/press enter to view the screen for a score</p></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc"><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You can press . (by default) to open the context menu for charts (or for scores with the above scoreboard navigation feature)
Equivalent to right-clicking.</p></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc"><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Added and updated a BUNCH of hotkeys around level select for ease of navigation with keyboard-only if that pleases you</p></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc"><p class="leading-8 mb-4">The hotkey for many level select buttons are shown when displaying the tooltip info for that button.

It couldn't tell the difference between 0.6.5.1 and 0.6.5.2 so thought the game was up to date
So I created this feature release (albeit small) that you can update to</p></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc"><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Added a changelog button to the main menu
It reuses the ingame wiki feature to view the full Interlude changelog
It turns yellow when an update is available</p></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc"><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Ingame wiki/changelog now has a button at the top to install updates
You can also still update via the debug menu</p></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc"><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Added a Discord button the main menu.

This will break your collections.json if you have a Goals collection (I'm certain nobody is)</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">There are other collections changes coming up which may break collections
When the time comes, if anyone really does have collections they want to preserve give me a shout in the discord</p></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc"><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You can now hold right-click to fast scroll on scrolling containers.

Getting the wrong judgement loses a life
When you run out of lives, you missed out on the lamp!</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Special feature: Challenging scores!
To challenge a score, right click it in the scoreboard and select "Challenge"
This will make it a pacemaker as you play, and indicate if you are ahead or behind the existing score's pace
Being ahead/behind is updated based on the accuracy you had at that point in the chart (not final accuracy of that score)</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">To access pacemaker settings you can either:
- Configure them as before under Options &gt; Gameplay &gt; Pacemaker
- Configure them under the Mods menu in level select</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">The pacemaker must be turned on by you when you want to use it (it is not always on)
This is to make it something you declare to yourself you're going to do right before playing (a bit like using Sudden Death in osu!)
I'm interested in what effect this has:
- Maybe it will make you play better and focus properly
- Maybe it will be used to signify the end of warming up
- Maybe it will never get used because everyone will forget to turn it on</p></div><div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-3xl">0.6.4</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">New features around user settings!</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Under Themes &gt; Edit Theme &gt; Gameplay Config you can now edit the position and other settings about gameplay widgets<ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Includes accuracy meter, combo meter, hit meter and more</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Includes tooltips explaining what things do</li></ul></li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Added a color picker for screen covers, allowing you to change the color from ingame</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Fixed several bugs with gameplay widgets that were discovered while putting these settings in</li></ul><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You can now do more theme stuff in-game (and see its effects quicker) instead of making manual edits in your theme folder</p></div><div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-3xl">0.6.3.1</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">This release is a test of my automated publishing system :)</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Improved buttons on import screen mounts by moving them up slightly</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">You may also notice the release zip just has an exe, locale file and audio dll.
